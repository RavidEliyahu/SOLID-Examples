# SOLID-Principles-Examples
Welcome to the Solid Principles Learning Hub! This repository is a collection of resources and examples designed to help you understand and apply the SOLID principles in your software development projects.

Whether you are new to object-oriented programming or an experienced developer, these resources will provide you with a deeper understanding of these important design guidelines and how to use them to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

So join us and start exploring the SOLID principles today! Happy coding!
| Principle Name        | Acronym           | Slogen | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| -----|
| [Single Responsibility](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/SRP) | S | One class, one responsibility | A class or module should have only one reason to change.| 
| [Open Closed](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/OCP) | O | Extend, don't modify | A class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification. | 
| [Liskov Substitution](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/LSP) | L | When in doubt, swap it out! | Subtypes should be able to substitute for their supertypes without affecting the correctness of the program. | 
| [Interface Segregation](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/ISP) | I | Use only what you need | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.| 
| [Dependency Invesion](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/DIP) | D | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions.|
