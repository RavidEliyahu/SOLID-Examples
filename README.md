# SOLID-Principles-Examples
Welcome to the Solid Principles Learning Hub! This repository is a collection of resources and examples designed to help you understand and apply the SOLID principles in your software development projects.

Whether you are new to object-oriented programming or an experienced developer, these resources will provide you with a deeper understanding of these important design guidelines and how to use them to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

You'll find a variety of resources in this repository, including interactive quizzes, coding challenges, and hands-on exercises that will help you learn and practice the SOLID principles in a fun and engaging way.

So join us and start exploring the SOLID principles today! Happy coding!
| Principle Name        | Acronym           | Slogen | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| -----|
| [Single Responsibility](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/SRP) | S | One class, one responsibility | A class or module should have only one reason to change.| 
| [Open Closed](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/OCP) | O | Extend, don't modify | A class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification. | 
| [Liskov Substitution](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/LSP) | L | Substitutability is key | Subtypes should be able to substitute for their supertypes without affecting the correctness of the program. | 
| [Interface Segregation](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/ISP) | I | Use only what you need | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.| 
| [Dependency Invesion](https://github.com/RavidEliyahu/SOLID-Principles-Examples/tree/main/SOLID/DIP) | D | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions.|
